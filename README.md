phtopgraphs. I was also introduced to GitHub and the git language by linking my Cloud9 account with my

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson I was introduced to a completly new concept for me. I learned about version 
    control systems and what they are capable of. I learned a few git commands and was able to 
    successfully like my Cloud9 account to my GitHub account through the use of these git commands.
2. Version Control Systems is a new concept introduced in this lesson. I did not knwo anything about 
    these systems before this, I had never even heard of them. These systems have massive cpabilties 
    and make colaboration on files very easy. They are a dynamic way to save changes by every user and a 
    log of descriptions of those changes and who made them. 
3. Setting up a GitHub account and using git language to successfully link it to my Cloud9 account was 
    also a lesson I learned while completing this assignment.
