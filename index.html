            <p class="lead">Git is what is known as a version control system. It is used to track the 
                            changes made to computer files and coordinate the work done on those files 
                            by multiple people. It can be used to keep track of changes made to any type 
                            of file but it is primarily used for source code management by software 
                            developers. Git Hub is what is known as a distributed control version system 
                            which focuses on speed, data integrity, and support. Every Git directory is a 
                            repository that contains a complete history of all changes and complete 
                            tracking abilities. Git is an open source software and is distributed for free.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is essentially a copy of the repository the user is currently 
                            working in which allows the user to push changes made to a file in one repository 
                            to another. The remote repository is hosted on the git hosting service GitHub. 
                            Typically, in a project there is one remote repository  and it is known as the central 
                            repository. The remote repository can be cloned to other computers and changes can be 
                            made by others but the changes will not affect the original repository unless the 
                            changes are pushed up to central repo and pulled down to the original machine. The 
                            benefit of having the remote repository is that any project can be reverted to a previous 
                            orm because snapshots of every change are made.</p>

            <p class="lead">The local repository is the reference to the copy of the files that are on the machine 
                            you are currently working and pushing to eventually be committed. Changes made here can 
                            be deleted. This local repository has all the same capabilities as the remote repository. 
                            Changes made to files must be pushed and committed to the remote repository to save the 
                            snapchats. The local repository is what contains the working directory and the staging 
                            area, where pushed files remain until committed. This is the repository where commands 
                            like git add, git push, git commit, git merge, and git checkout will be used.</p>

            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records all changes, modifications, and alterations 
                            made to a file or set of files. GitHub is a version control system that is designed to 
                            do this while allowing for collaboration among a few or even many contributors. These 
                            systems have a central repository that holds all the files and users of the system 
                            checkout the files they need to work on, make changes on their own local repository on 
                            their own machine, the push and commit those changes back to the central repository. 
                            Snapchats of the files are kept every step of the way so that files can be reverted to 
                            a previous form.</p>

            <p class="lead">The commit command is expressed as git commit in the git language. This is the command 
                            that basically just records all changes to a repository. While it sounds simple, this is 
                            one of the most and essential commands in git. It stores all current changes in a new 
                            commit into a repository with a log that has a description of all the changes from the 
                            user. The commit command is used in junction with many options such as git commit â€“a, 
                            which tells the command to automatically stage all files that have been modified and 
                            deleted. Many other options are aviliable that tell the git commit command to perform 
                            many actions.</p>
